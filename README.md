# Basics-of-API-Testing

This file contains the basic codes of API Testing.
There are 2 folders in the Demo Project >> src: -
1. Basics_of_Restassured
2. Basic_Json_Parsing

1. Basics_of_Restassured contains all the basic operations that we can perform using restassured and hamcrest like getting the response, performing basic assertions, etc

2. Basic_Json_Parsing contains Basics.java, ComplexJsonParse.java, and SumValidation.java files which contain the codes.
a. Basics.java is the first file.
b. ComplexJsonParse.java is the second file.
c. SumValidation.java is the third file.

ComplexJson.txt contains JSON response and the task details that are performed in the ComplexJsonParse.java file.

There is a files folder.
1.  It contains a payload.java file which contains JSON body and response which are used in Basics.java, ComplexJsonParse.java, and SumValidation.java files.

2.  It also contains ReUsableMethods.java which is used in the Basics .java file.

pom.xml contains all the configurations of the project.

Only these files are created by me to write codes.
Rest all files and folders are created automatically.


target and test-output folders are created automatically while running the Testng script.


Overall through these codes, we will learn about the basic API parsing process in API Testing.

Here JSON Body and Response is passed as a String.
